# Not an Expert Pack

A pack for 1.12.2. In very early development. It needs a better name, known also as "geckpack".


## Mod notes

[Mod List](MODLIST.md)

### Mods that may be included, but not a priority
- Refined Storage (Just configuration files) (AE2 is better but people seem to like RS)
- Apotheosis
- Vampirism

### Mods that may be removed
- Advent of Ascension (Low quality compared to DivineRPG, but the sheer content it adds can be useful in pack progression)
